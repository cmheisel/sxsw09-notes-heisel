## Neocartography: Mapping Design and Usability Evolved

* Default online state of mapping is red pins on Google maps
* At Stamen try to get away from standard views of maps
* Google base maps make it easy to quickly put content on the map, without having to worry about the underlying map
* Google Maps have overtaken Mapquest in U.S.
* Google Maps are road maps, designed to get you from point A to point B
  * If you're trying to display non-point-to-point data, a different base map is called for b/c the street data is overkill
  * Ask yourself what kind of data are you showing?
  * http://www.cloudmade.com/
* Google doesn't offer a way to modify the basemap
  * So you probably have to go your own way/roll your own
* Google has standardized the interface for maps
  * Everyone knows how to use the Google standard controls, the click and drag, clicking on a point, etc.
  * So preserve that interface when you're building a custom map

10:00 am - 11:00 am

Designers are dropping maps into their applications with little concern for usability or design and users are getting "Google Map fatigue". We need to move beyond the simple pin-dropping and consider appropriate mapping interfaces. This panel will look at the current and emerging tools to provide compelling geographic interaction and visualization.
