This is not a discussion of whether ebooks are killing treebooks, or whether it's possible to get cozy with an Amazon Kindle. It's about how participatory culture and the online world interact with good olde book publishing.Clay Shirky, author of Here Comes Everybody, Deborah Schultz, and fellow panelists will share with the audience a variety of perspectives on what's going right and what's going wrong in publishing, assess success of recent forays into marketing digitally, digital publishing, and what books and blogs have to gain from one another. Penguin Group (USA), which houses some 40 plus imprints and publishes an extremely broad variety of physical and digital products�everything from William Gibson's first ebook in the 90's to Michael Pollan's In Defense of Food to Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse novels (the source for HBO's True Blood)�is deeply involved in exploring ways that old and new media might better collaborate. Audience members are invited to speak up about what they think book publishers could/should be doing to better provide relevant information and content to blogs, websites, and online communities. Come tell old media what you want and how you want it.
