# New Think for Old Publishers
http://sxsw.mobi/interactive/conference/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP0901368

* Writings captured the body of knowledge, but lost the conversations of the previous oral tradition
* Web is re-incorporating concept of discussion and conversation back into writings
  * Talmud was post down the middle with commentary on the left and right
  * There were "bloggers" who recorded conversations and observations like Josephus
* "The internet is the largest group of people who care about reading and writing ever assembled in history -- now what?"
* This is a medium where teenagers are rushing home to start writing
* 80,000 word blog post would be a little inconvienent
* Funny notion of the author as the sole creator of what's on the page
  * Compare with video, we know a lot of people work on that
  * Words have editors as well
* "I'm driving an ammo book" -- techy comes up after book is pub'd and says "you gave me something the right size to hit my boss over the head with"
* Finding stuff you didn't know you were looking for is difficult still
* "I'm not hearing anything thinking" - Questioner
*

This is not a discussion of whether ebooks are killing treebooks, or whether it's possible to get cozy with an Amazon Kindle. It's about how participatory culture and the online world interact with good olde book publishing.Clay Shirky, author of Here Comes Everybody, Deborah Schultz, and fellow panelists will share with the audience a variety of perspectives on what's going right and what's going wrong in publishing, assess success of recent forays into marketing digitally, digital publishing, and what books and blogs have to gain from one another. Penguin Group (USA), which houses some 40 plus imprints and publishes an extremely broad variety of physical and digital products�everything from William Gibson's first ebook in the 90's to Michael Pollan's In Defense of Food to Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse novels (the source for HBO's True Blood)�is deeply involved in exploring ways that old and new media might better collaborate. Audience members are invited to speak up about what they think book publishers could/should be doing to better provide relevant information and content to blogs, websites, and online communities. Come tell old media what you want and how you want it.
