http://www.slideshare.net/zappos/zappos-sxsw-31409

* Record label exec's wife bought $62,000 in shoes
* Originally running pizza biz in ground floor or dorm
* Hired, made and delivered pizzas
* Alfred, now COO and CFO, ordered every night with freq. pizza diners card
* "The human trash compactor"
* He'd come by a short time later and buy another pizza -- taking them upstairs and selling them by the slize
* Started link exchange, but sould it to MS b/c the company culture had changed
* Cofounded company but dreaded going into the office
* Formed a venture fund, Zappos was one of them
* Sell more than shoes -- clothing, cosmetics, housewares, etc.
* Want to be about the very best customer experience
* "Will you please start an airline or run the IRS"
* Look to Virgin for inspiration
* Virgin is hip and cool, Zappos wants to be the very best in customer service
* Fortune 100 Best Companies to work for
* Was a corporate goal from day one to get on that list
* On any given day, 75% of customers are return customers
* Take money you would spend on marketing and put into customer retention -- viral word of mouth takes its place
* 0 sales in 1999, $1B in sales in 2008
* Hard to find contact info on most web sites, number at top of every page on Zappos
* Most calls aren't purchases
* Telephone is one of the best branding devices -- undivided attention for 5-10 minutes
* 5k calls a day
* 365 day return policy
* Policies that any company can copy -- not just policies it's experience
* Only show items on Web site that we _know_ are in our warehouse
* It hurts top line revenue, but it makes for a better experience (no "sorry this is backordered" e-mail)
* Started off showing items they didn't have, accounted for 25% of sales in early years
* As focus became customer service they had to trade in 25% revenue for customer service gains
* Surprise upgrade for repeat loyal customers -- shipping speed upgrade (that takes advantage of human reward surprise psychology CMH)
* Is it expensive -- yes. But they consider it their marketing dollars.
* All their customer service costs are marketing costs.
* Call center directs people to competitor Web sites if they don't have the item the customer is looking for
* Not trying to maximize each transaction, trying to build life long relationship with customers
* No scripts, no upselling and no call times (average handle time, most folks try to optimize for shorter time)
* Tell reps: Spend as much time as you think is necessary for wowing the customer
* 4 hour long customer call is record
* Warehouse run 24/7 (not efficient, let orders pile up and then picker has higher order density)
* Customer service isn't number 1 priority -- culture is the number one priority
* Everything else, cust service included, flows down from that
* Starts with hiring -- 2 sets of interviews. HR does 2nd set that is purely for culture fit
* If someone is bad for the culture, they are fired purely for that -- 50% of eval is on culture
* Everyone goes through call center training, 5 weeks, no matter what job position
* 2 weeks of training is actual call center work, 2 weeks is warehouse work
* Offer to pay people to leave plus $2k bonus to leave until end of training
* $11/hour is starting pay for call center reps
* 2007 - 3% take the offer
* 2008 - 1% take the offer
* Keep increasing the offer b/c too few people are taking it!
* Biggest benefit from people that decided not to take the offer -- employee had to go home and think about, talk to friend/family to give up money. When they come back they're more committed and engaged (takes advantage of human loss bias CMH)
* Culture book once a year
* Each employee writes a few paragraphs -- unedited except for typos -- given to prosepective hires
* Twitter -- found it at SXSW
* Rolled it out to the entire company -- have Twitter class as part of new hire orientation. Up to each employee whether they continue use it.
* 1,400 employees -- 700 in vegas -- 400 on twitter
* Helps employees meet up outside office, and see each other as people inside office
* "Want a cheeseburger" -- a cheese burger showed up (CKraft telling me about Reese's!!! CMH)
* twitter.zappos.com -- All 400 users in the company
* Brand and culture are the same -- one may lag for a bit they all catch up at some point
* Web 2.0 transparency is the cause
* Airlines industry -- most people talk about bad customer service, that is the brand of the industry
* That's not what any exec set out to brand their company, but that's what it is
* Women ordered a wallet from Zappos, got surprise upgrade -- send it back
* She put $150 in the wallet and forgot to take it out -- chased her 2 kids around thinking they had stolen it
* Got a letter from warehouse worker who had processed the return -- found the money thought you might want it back, thanks for shopping
* $150 is pretty sig chunk for warehouse worker
* In warehouse they hire for culture, long term vision of the company
* Customer service should be the entire company, not just a department
* Could've had cameras and screenings and supervisors -- but it'd be very expensive
* Take that security money and put it into the hiring process -- situations take care of themselves
* 3-Cs: Clothing, Customer Service, Culture
* Lifecycle of a new customer, come for the clothing, find the customer service, finally understand the culture
* "Zappos is happiness in a box"
* Zappos delivers happiness -- to customers and employees and partners
* Commitable Core Values -- comitable is the key word
* Most core values are lofty and meaningless
* Committable means willing to hire and fire based on it
* Zappos 10 core values: deliver WOW through service, embrace and drive change, create fun and little weirdness, be adventerous creative and open minded, Pursue Growth and Learning, Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication, Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit, Do More With Less, Be Passionate and Determined, Be Humble (list online: http://about.zappos.com/our-unique-culture/zappos-core-values)
* Be humble is the toughest -- a lot of folks who had value to the company are jerks and it's not one hire that does it, but they add up
* Celebrate individuality -- decorated cubes
* Ask hires to count number of headlines and photos in fake newspaper -- headline says the number is 37 tell the person and get $100 -- people who consider themselves unlucky take longer to count the headlines (they ignore the tip), people who consider themselves lucky collect the $100
* Book: "Good to great"
* 7 steps for building a brand that matters
  * 1. Decide -- There's a lot of tradeoffs you have to make, takes patience (25% of rev. for Zappos)
  * 2. Figure out values & cultures -- Used to think "that's big corporate culture", wish that Zappos had done it sooner
    * Don't have a brand position statement, culture is their brand
    * Reporters can interview anyone they like b/c they hire people who's personal values align with companies values/culture
  * 3. Commit to transparency -- Reporters, twitter.zappos.com, culture book, "be real and use your best judgement", Newsletter called "Ask Anything" e-mail in questions about anything, and questions are answered: financials, brands, "do vegetarians eat animal crackers"
    * Extranet for vendors -- can see sales, turn, profitability
    * Worried about compeitors -- it probably does, but we have an extra 1,500 pairs of eyes helping us manage our business (that aren't on our payroll)
    * Zappos insights -- Entrepenuer can ask questions about recruiting, etc. and Zappos shares
  * 4. Vision -- Used to be about just shoes, customer service was something employees could get excited about -- engaged about cust service but not profits or size in a category, etc.
    * Chase the vision, not the money. (And the money will follow)
    * What would you be passionate about doing for 10 years, even if you never made a dime
    * What's the larger vision or greater purpose in their work beyond money or profits?
    * Motivaion vs. Inspiration -- Accomplish more by inspiring them to a bigger vision vs. motivating through rewards
  * 5. Build relationships -- Meet interesting people, 2-3 years later that interesting person will likely benefit you or your company (as opposed to meeting people who can immediately help you)
    * Payoff for customer service is long term (2009 profits would help if he fired customer care team, but it'd hurt his '10 and '11 revenue)
    * If you want to go quickly, go alone, if you want to go far, go togehter
      * Hire slowly and fire quickly
    * What is your goal in life? Keep asking "Why?" and it ends up in happiness (start a company, retire early, spend time travelling, happiness)
  * 6. People are bad at predicting long term happiness -- lottery studies show folks at same/lower levels before/after winning
    * Happiness is about: perceived control, perceived progress, 
    * Turned 18 month cycles for promotion in buyer track into 6 month tracks (still take 3 years), goes toward perceived progress
    * Book: Peak by Chip Connely (sp?), Tribal leadership (company culture) audio book free from Zappos, 4 hour work week, Happiness Hypothesis
    * 3 types of happiness -- Rock star (pleasure), Flow (engagement time flies), Meaning/Higher Purpose (part of something bigger than yourself)
    * Find something that has meaning, then get into flow, rock star happiness is icing on cake
    * Presentation available online
* Zappos rep, late night pizza call from Sketchers conference, -- we don't sell pizza yet, rep puts her on old, comes back with list of pizza delivery places still open 
* E-mail tony@zappos.com -- ask for copy of presentation, include physical address for copy of culture book

## My takeaways
* I'd like to work at Zappos :-)
