# More Secrets of JavaScript Libraries

* YUI Get & Loader
  * JS loading blocks page render
  * As js files increase, your blocking time increases
  * Single file is best -- reduce HTTP requests
  * But widgets and plugins have preqs and deps
  * Sites are using multiple unrelated JS files
  * Larger projects need multiple files for flexibility
  * Most files are order dependent
  * As dev, nice to be able to toggle between -min and -debug and -raw
  * Handles prereqs w/out dupes -- YUI Get and Loader
  * Does dynamic node creation to avoid I/O blocking
  * Cross-domain data resource capability (sweet), as long as it's GET
  * Loads anything -- CSS, JS, JSON, Urchin.js
  * Easy hash to define resources
  * Lazy loading
  
* Meta-Language Frameworks
  * GWT, Pyjamas, Cappuccino (Obj-J into JS)
  * Narrative JS -- allows for sleep() like calls
  * Google Caja -- Turns JS into safer JS
  * Cappuccino invents new syntax on top of Obj-C favorite syntax
  * At cost of being distant from your runtime code
  * Abstractions leak...
  * Counter argument that all frameworks involve abstractions, we use abstractions despite their leakage
  * The thicker the abstraction, the more the reward and the hassle
  * Compare up-front vs. on-going costs
  * We're "stuck" with Javascript
 
* Real World Accessibility
  * People with disabilities don't use my site -- that's like saying left handed or blue-eyed people don't use your site
  * Adding A11y is way too hard and it will ruin my design -- Dojo, jQueryUI
  * ARIA -- Accesible Rich Internet Applications, spec in W3C process
  * Implemented in Firefox, IE8, Opera and Safari are developing
  * Add role semantics into scripted UI elements
  * Can tell screenreader "this is a screencontrol", or "this is the selected tab panel"
  * Adds keyboard event handling: onClick != Enter key

* Performance and Testing
  * Typically measure execution within JS environment
  * jQuery stack profiler -- looks for problematic methods and calls
  * Problem is that time measurements w/in JS is problematic
  * Windows JS only has a 15 ms resolution -- so sub 15 ms tasks can't be measured
  * Firebug, Safari 4 Profiler, IE8 profiler
  * FireUnit -- has a getProfile method
  * Allows for complexity analysis -- lets you reduce call count which reduces complexity
  * .remove() was fast but it called 2n+n^2 methods (as opposed to 5n or 3n)
  * QUnit -- jQuery test frame work
  * Do cost/benefit analysis on what browsers you support -- browsers with more market share get more time
  * Cost of development == time spent on browser bugs
  * IE6 costs higher than benefits
  * JQuery has 11 browsers with 6 test suites, not including multiple platforms
  * JS testing doesn't scale well
  * TestSwarm -- Distributed network of doing automated network
  * Suite into Swarm, various clients are doing the testing
  * Scales up to manual testing -- users follow predefined steps, answer Yes/No questions which is pushed back into cloud
  * TestSwarm.com -- opens at end of the month, incentives for top testers

## Panel info
Saturday, March 14th

11:30 am - 12:30 pm

In a reprise from last year's popular panel - the JavaScript libraries authors are getting together again to impart their what they've learned from their experience in developing solid, world-class, JavaScript libraries. Covering everything from advanced aspects of the JavaScript language, to handling cross-browser issues, all the way up to packaging and distribution. A complete set of knowledge for a JavaScript developer.
