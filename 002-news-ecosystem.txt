## The Ecosystem of News
http://sxsw.mobi/interactive/conference/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP0901396

* "Old Growth Media"
* Used to wait every 3 weeks outside a bookstore for the latest issue of MacWorld (b/c subscriptions arrived a few days later)
* What was life like before the web
* If you wanted news on the Mac landscape, there was only one channel available -- MacWorld
* Even if you waited for the mag, you'd get the news from there a month or two late b/c of the long lead times of magazines
* Then came Compuserve -- MacWeek was uploading articles every Friday night at 6 p.m. (nerd appointment TV)
* Wired Magazine launches
* Web arrives -- MacInTouch
* Salon adds tech critics
* Apple launches Web site -- can get news directly from the source ASAP
* Now we have to-the-second thanks to live blogging, in-depth tech from ars.technical, Gruber's deep analysis of UI design
* David Pogue and Walt Mossberg
* More E.O. Wilson now than McLuhan --- ecosystem now
* That makes it much more difficult to predict where it's going to go
* Mac news in 1987 was a barren desert, today it's a thriving rain forest
* 2 worst case scenarios
  * Newspapers will disappear as businesses
  * That crucial information will disappear with them
* War reporters and investigative journalists are the big concerns
  * Will bloggers switch PJs for Baghdad bureau
* New ecosystem of investigative journalism is in it's infancy -- by both non and for profits
* Ecologists seek out old growth forests
* Technology journalism is the "old growth forest" of the Web
  * Web covers technology first b/c the people using it first were interested in it more than school boards or NFL
* Compare 1992 election -- NYT, Newsweek, Crossfire, New Republic, New Yorker
* 2008 election -- TPM, Politico, Daily Kos, Andew Sullivan, HuffPo, fivethirtyeight.com, plus information directly from the candidates
* Imagine 1992 coverage of Race speech in Philly -- CNN might have aired live, no fox news or MSNBC back then, otherwise 1 minute sound bite on nightly news
* Old growth complained "Parasitic" -- bloggers just linked to traditional media
* "Clinging to guns and religion" -- quote originated with HuffPo, not old growth
* We lived in a desert disguised as a rainforest
* Claim loss of a newspaper biggest damage is the local coverage -- but it's probably going to look like 87s MacWorld
* City section of NYTimes has 2-3 articles he's interested in, but in his neighborhood there's probably 20 stories -- 2 muggings, deli opening, etc.
* Economic model of NYTimes can't support long tail coverage
* Standards about what good local coverage are are going to improve
* 5 years from now if I don't get an alert when a mugging happens within 3 blocks of my house and I don't get an alert in 3 hours or less, something will be broken
* More content -- info, analysis, precision, niches
* Investigative and international reporting probably won't thrive in this
* But it may free up traditional reporters to cover those areas, while they scoop up the rest
* Jeff Jarvis -- Do what you do best and link to the rest
* It is far more complicated to navigate this world than it is your morning newspaper
* A lot more noise -- but you have to be a savvy information navigator
* Let's say we can't ask ave. user to do that
  * They need an authoritative guide
  * A brand known for integrity and a trained staff of editors, where would we find that :-)
  * newspaper.com audience is growing faster than print audience is shrinking
  * Judged by aud. interest -- newspapers have never been more relevant
  * All the news that's fit to link
  * Prof journalists -- Prof Bloggers -- Non-profit journ
  * Amateur Bloggers -- Direct Events -- Public Data APIs
  * News (above) feeds into Commentary: Pundints/Columnists -- Bloggers -- Scholars 
  * Curation -- Social Media (link sharing via Twitter) -- Professional Editors -- Aggregators -- Group Filters (digg)
  * Distribution: Traditional Media (newspaper.coms) -- Aggregators (HuffPo) -- Viral Word of Mouth (FB feed)
  * Does this model have flaws -- of course
  * Is it better than the model we've lived with -- despite it's flaws,yes
* Newspaper industry is ugly and it's going to get uglier
* Should've been a 10 year evolutionary process, paper/ads slowly transitioning
* Process been compressed into 2 years
* Bad b/c of the human cost, and it'll distract us from the long term view (too busy trying to keep the old model alive)

* Guy from Seattle (no news is bad news project):
  * "Somebody has to be paid to do this effectively" -- what's the business model
  * In this economy who's going to put the money down to invest in the transition
  * Biz model talks reminds SJ of Web talk in mid-to-late 90s -- saying that ads will come online b/c of measurability
  * In the same situation with local advertising, they need geographic targeting locally and locally-nationwide (hipster neighborhoods for a natl chain)
  * There'll be an ecosystem of advertising neighborhoods
  * It will not be the fat margins of old
  * Consumers aren't ready for the switch from print to digital ecosystem
  
* Joan Reeves, Missouri Journalism Reynold Institute
  * What newspapers have in average correctness, the blogosphere is making up in terms of speed to correct initial mistakes
  * Had a Kindle for two weeks -- paying for stuff I used to get for free

* Question about writing style constraint between "low brow" online and "high brow" traditional media
  * Some things are getting shorter, but a lot is getting longer Lost is a 120 hour show
  * Ave page length of books is getting larger
  * It's not that culture is getting shorter or longer, it's both
  * Google Book Search vs. Twitter
  * 250 page book vs. Twittering about it (on tour) These are mortal enemies, right -- but it's an ecosystem, they have a niche where they succeed
 
 * Enlightment's lack of structure -- Franklin and Aires (sp?) experimenting outside of a university -- compared with Web 2.0's free formity "Enlightenment 2.0"
 
 * Newspapers will have staffs, smaller, but cutting the costs of print is probably their biggest savings
   * HuffPo and others will have to figure out a model where they pay their content creators
   * Thinks ad networks are the future (decentralizing effect fits with Web's decentralizing nature)
   
 * What happens when filters are so good, you only see the news you want?
   * Blogosphere is providing SJ the "really did not know I wanted to see, but I know I want to see it" and not the NYTimes -- BoingBoing for SJ
   * If surprise is what you are seeking out, the Web is the greatest provider of serendipity in the history of media
   * Newspapers old model forced people into being surprised (on your way to Sports your surprised by a coup in Africa) -- people think they don't like to be surprised, but they do
 
 
##My takeaways
* There is hope
* Focus on what roles in the ecosystem you want to own/play in: probably orig reporting, aggregation, pundits/columnists, social filtering, API consumption
* Concentrate on being the builder of networks -- you'll get more of a cut on a much smaller pie (then print revs)
* Aggregate the long tail -- by networks with existing local bloggers, creating your own local network of bloggers


##Panel information

Friday, March 13th

3:30 pm - 4:30 pm

It is now conventional wisdom that the newspaper as we have come to know it for last century is over, or will be in a matter of years. The question is whether we're going to spend our time grieving over the loss, or whether we're going to use this moment as an opportunity to invent something even better. We're inevitably moving from the "paper of record" model to a something more distributed, a news ecosystem, but that doesn't mean we can't consciously define the shape of that system. So let's figure out what values we want to preserve from the older newspaper paradigm, and what values we want to improve upon -- and then let's go build it!
