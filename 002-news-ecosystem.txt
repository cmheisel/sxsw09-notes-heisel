## The Ecosystem of News

* "Old Growth Media"
* Used to wait every 3 weeks outside a bookstore for the latest issue of MacWorld (b/c subscriptions arrived a few days later)
* What was life like before the web
* If you wanted news on the Mac landscape, there was only one channel available -- MacWorld
* Even if you waited for the mag, you'd get the news from there a month or two late b/c of the long lead times of magazines
* Then came Compuserve -- MacWeek was uploading articles every Friday night at 6 p.m. (nerd appointment TV)
* Wired Magazine launches
* Web arrives -- MacInTouch
* Salon adds tech critics
* Apple launches Web site -- can get news directly from the source ASAP
* Now we have to-the-second thanks to live blogging, in-depth tech from ars.technical, Gruber's deep analysis of UI design
* David Pogue and Walt Mossberg
* More E.O. Wilson now than McLuhan --- ecosystem now
* That makes it much more difficult to predict where it's going to go
* Mac news in 1987 was a barren desert, today it's a thriving rain forest
* 2 worst case scenarios
  * Newspapers will disappear as businesses
  * That crucial information will disappear with them
* War reporters and investigative journalists are the big concerns
  * Will bloggers switch PJs for Baghdad bureau
* New ecosystem of investigative journalism is in it's infancy -- by both non and for profits
* Ecologists seek out old growth forests
* Technology journalism is the "old growth forest" of the Web
  * Web covers technology first b/c the people using it first were interested in it more than school boards or NFL
* Compare 1992 election -- NYT, Newsweek, Crossfire, New Republic, New Yorker
* 2008 election -- TPM, Politico, Daily Kos, Andew Sullivan, HuffPo, fivethirtyeight.com, plus information directly from the candidates
* Imagine 1992 coverage of Race speech in Philly -- CNN might have aired live, no fox news or MSNBC back then, otherwise 1 minute sound bite on nightly news
* Old growth complained "Parasitic" -- bloggers just linked to traditional media
* "Clinging to guns and religion" -- quote originated with HuffPo, not old growth
* We lived in a desert disguised as a rainforest
* Claim loss of a newspaper biggest damage is the local coverage -- but it's probably going to look like 87s MacWorld
* City section of NYTimes has 2-3 articles he's interested in, but in his neighborhood there's probably 20 stories -- 2 muggings, deli opening, etc.
* Economic model of NYTimes can't support long tail coverage
* Standards about what good local coverage are are going to improve
* 5 years from now if I don't get an alert when a mugging happens within 3 blocks of my house and I don't get an alert in 3 hours or less, something will be broken
* More content -- info, analysis, precision, niches
* Investigative and international reporting probably won't thrive in this
* But it may free up traditional reporters to cover those areas, while they scoop up the rest
* Jeff Jarvis -- Do what you do best and link to the rest
* It is far more complicated to navigate this world than it is your morning newspaper
* A lot more noise -- but you have to be a savvy information navigator
* Let's say we can't ask ave. user to do that
  * They need an authoritative guide
  * A brand known for integrity and a trained staff of editors, where would we find that :-)
  * newspaper.com audience is growing faster than print audience is shrinking
  * Judged by aud. interest -- newspapers have never been more relevant
  * All the news that's fit to link
  * Prof journalists -- Prof Bloggers -- Non-profit journ
  * Amateur Bloggers -- Direct Events -- Public Data APIs
  * News (above) feeds into Commentary: Pundints/Columnists -- Bloggers -- Scholars 
  * Curation -- Social Media (link sharing via Twitter) -- Professional Editors -- Aggregators -- Group Filters (digg)
  * Distribution: Traditional Media (newspaper.coms) -- Aggregators (HuffPo) -- Viral Word of Mouth (FB feed)
  * Does this model have flaws -- of course
  * Is it better than the model we've lived with -- despite it's flaws,yes
* Newspaper industry is ugly and it's going to get uglier
* Should've been a 10 year evolutionary process, paper/ads slowly transitioning
* Process been compressed into 2 years
* Bad b/c of the human cost, and it'll distract us from the long term view (too busy trying to keep the old model alive)

* Guy from Seattle (no news is bad news project):
  * "Somebody has to be paid to do this effectively" -- what's the business model
  * In this economy who's going to put the money down to invest in the transition
  * Biz model talks reminds SJ of Web talk in mid-to-late 90s -- saying that ads will come online b/c of measurability
  * In the same situation with local advertising, they need geographic targeting locally and locally-nationwide (hipster neighborhoods for a natl chain)
  * There'll be an ecosystem of advertising neighborhoods
  * It will not be the fat margins of old
  * Consumers aren't ready for the switch from print to digital ecosystem
  
* Joan Reeves, Missouri Journalism Reynold Institute
  * What newspapers have in average correctness, the blogosphere is making up in terms of speed to correct initial mistakes
  * Had a Kindle for two weeks -- paying for stuff I used to get for free

* Question about writing style constraint between "low brow" online and "high brow" traditional media
  * Some things are getting shorter, but a lot is getting longer Lost is a 120 hour show
  * Ave page length of books is getting larger
  * It's not that culture is getting shorter or longer, it's both
  * Google Book Search vs. Twitter
  * 250 page book vs. Twittering about it (on tour) These are mortal enemies, right -- but it's an ecosystem, they have a niche where they succeed
 
 * Enlightment's lack of structure -- Franklin and Aires (sp?) experimenting outside of a university -- compared with Web 2.0's free formity "Enlightenment 2.0"
 
 * Newspapers will have staffs, smaller, but cutting the costs of print is probably their biggest savings
   * HuffPo and others will have to figure out a model where they pay their content creators
   * Thinks ad networks are the future (decentralizing effect fits with Web's decentralizing nature)
   
 * What happens when filters are so good, you only see the news you want?
   * Blogosphere is providing SJ the "really did not know I wanted to see, but I know I want to see it" and not the NYTimes -- BoingBoing for SJ
   * If surprise is what you are seeking out, the Web is the greatest provider of serendipity in the history of media
   * Newspapers old model forced people into being surprised (on your way to Sports your surprised by a coup in Africa) -- people think they don't like to be surprised, but they do
