# Bruce Sterling Session
* Book publishing has similar tale to that of newspaper industry -- slow decline and a few recent blows to the chin tipping over a perilous business model
* Every journalist/publisher is facing this problem
* Media god knows they were told about, ages ago -- spent 20 years making fun of a paperless office/paperless society
* Kindle is like a plugin cassette for an Atari 400
* In the US, probably not going to go on as an author/journalists
* Global microbrand -- they don't want Bruce as a journalist, they want him as Bruce
* Something medieval about being a wondering pundit
* Why do you have a relationship with Bruce? Why do you have a relationship with the others, why are you here in this room?
* We're "the people formerly known as the audience"
* You thought you were having the free run of his house, but "the servers" were in his corner -- analogy to social media
* His parties were a social media hack -- bring anything you can carry and bring anyone you trust
* Worked well for 5-6 years until the audience changed -- party audience replaced by a bunch of social media influencers
* People would show up and hit their buddy list and people would poor in and bang "his servers" into oblivion
* Upshot is a loss
* Why do I have to treat with you any respect, I'm not your host, you're not my friends
* Even if you were poor you'd be intensely interconnected -- cell phones are cheap
* Connectivity will be a crueler kind of poverty
* Brave New Books in Austin -- far right post-Bush bookstore, had a multimedia outlet in the back; harbinger of something interesting
