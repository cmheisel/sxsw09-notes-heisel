# Bruce Sterling Session
* Book publishing has similar tale to that of newspaper industry -- slow decline and a few recent blows to the chin tipping over a perilous business model
* Every journalist/publisher is facing this problem
* Media god knows they were told about, ages ago -- spent 20 years making fun of a paperless office/paperless society
* Kindle is like a plugin cassette for an Atari 400
* In the US, probably not going to go on as an author/journalists
* Global microbrand -- they don't want Bruce as a journalist, they want him as Bruce
* Something medieval about being a wondering pundit
* Why do you have a relationship with Bruce? Why do you have a relationship with the others, why are you here in this room?
* We're "the people formerly known as the audience"
* You thought you were having the free run of his house, but "the servers" were in his corner -- analogy to social media
* His parties were a social media hack -- bring anything you can carry and bring anyone you trust
* Worked well for 5-6 years until the audience changed -- party audience replaced by a bunch of social media influencers
* People would show up and hit their buddy list and people would poor in and bang "his servers" into oblivion
* Upshot is a loss
* Why do I have to treat with you any respect, I'm not your host, you're not my friends
* Even if you were poor you'd be intensely interconnected -- cell phones are cheap
* Connectivity will be a crueler kind of poverty
* Brave New Books in Austin -- far right post-Bush bookstore, had a multimedia outlet in the back; harbinger of something interesting
* Bad thing when you get practical advice from a science fiction writer
  * Cure for depression is action
  * Don't be embarassed
  * Bad weather, lots of drug problems, narco-gangsters from Mexico
  * Micropayment statements -- urban ones owned by the city
  * Give away Linux netbooks
  * Austin genius grants -- 2 years he has go and leave, but try something and fail
  * Sunset provisions for corporation charters
  * HealthFoo camps
  * Elderly will be the backbone of a non-commericial social web -- make them work on free shit
* Global leaders aren't scapegoating other countries/peoples in these times -- credit to social media that we don't allow ourselves to be polarized
*
