* Didn't have ambition to become a big political analysis
* Was procrastinating on his other work, frustrated by CNN/NBC/FOX News get it wrong
* They weren't using much impirical evidence to justify their predictions
* He's not a big fan of polls -- they're poorly conducted and over promoted
* Race -- shouldn't lump any racial group of voters together
* Demographics is dead -- behavioral tribes are the new segments in Marketing/Advertising
* Book: The Numerati
* Infinite number of typologies with a large enough dataset you can find similar types and then predict
* Most Americans don't think about politics issue by issue -- voters dont get enough credit for their sophistication
* Baseball and politics: both have long "seasons"
* MLB teams place too much emphasis on most recent year of performance, and too much emphasis on offense
* Teams tend to underestimate how quickly players decline, bad with long contracts
* Economic crash affects on voters: Haven't had a situation like tis in the modern era
* People focus on recency, ignoring past recessions and depressions b/c it's not in the 10/20 year mental view
* How do you compare 1932/1948 to now: Over the long run the volatility has decreased (lows higher and highs lower)
* IBM tries to do similar prediction work with factory workers -- what are they worth in 3 years, 5 years, etc.
* Poorly executed objective prediction is worse than a well executed subjective decision
*
