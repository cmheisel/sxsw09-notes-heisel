* Don't need tons of money to get good data
* User observation: Cheap, fast, deadly
* Everybody lies, so watch them use it instead
* Can spend lots of money doing observation testing, or you can hide in the audience
* Flow state: Difficulty on Y axis, Skill on X axis
* Want your user to realize that they've had to pee for an hour :-)
* Get video and make people watch it  (impose on your loved ones) -- Silverback or Morae
* Video didn't make SL change orientation segment, but it did prompt the search for data that lead to the change
* Read your own documentation -- if you have doc about it, that's your problem, fix it!
* Watch the RSS -- Twitter, bloggers, etc. are talking about your product
* "Your software here" + "sucks|ungh|problem|etc." in Google

* Emotional Inquiry
* Inspired by Don Norman's book about emotional design
* Brought in existing users of mystery game -- given list of images from game, and list of words from compassionate communication Web site
* Want to get as many people in your company "behind the one way mirror" -- that's success

##My Takeaways
* Usability doens't have to cost a lot of money
* Do it early int he process
* Adjust your technology to make it easy to change quickly, close to the feedback, to get even better test results
