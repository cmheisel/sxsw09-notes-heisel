http://sxsw.mobi/interactive/conference/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP0900496

* Comedy is supplanting porn as the driver of technology on the Web
* Check out: The Lonely Island Album
* People who watch TV shows on the Internet, tend to be pickier about what they watch
* They also tend to watch alone
* Office writing staff has a "DJ" play internet humor videos during their lunch hour
* Comedy -- why succeed on Internet?
  * It has a quick punch, doesn't need a lot of story and character setup
  * Quick payoff
  * It's America's Funniest Home Videos -- but without Bog Sagat or the Jackalope -- it's what you want to share (which means you have to enable and promote sharing CMH)
* Letterman site supplements the show vs. Colbert Nation mobilizes army of loyal users
  * Naming contests
  * Green screen challenge -- Make John McCain interesting
  * Clips and references from Web make it on the air
  * Remixes after Lawrence Lessig spoke
  * "When you can pull off ironic self agrandisement, you've got it made" -- Novak
* Ad mis-mash -- 80% of time online, but ad spend is 2% online for some firms (Break.com)
  * Hour-by-hour -- Has more audience than 30 of the digital cable network, but they have an easier time monetizing than the site
  * Format: 30 seconds vs. pre-roll
  * All the types of providers are going to mix togther -- funny guy getting hit in the head, next to webisodes, etc.
* Nielson - Ave. American watches 151 hours of televisions a month
  * Boxee sees a lot of people are cancelling or downgrading cable, but it's not going to go away anytime soon
  * SXSW crowd are early adopters but it's headed that way
  * People don't care where the content is coming from (as long as it's in HD)
    * $10 cable between PC and TV and you can watch BSG and The Office
  * Always going to be a place for quality content, and budgets to support it
  * People don't care about studio vs. amateur -- they care about the humor, if it's funny they'll watch (NBC can make unfunny content)
  * The brand is the show, not the network
  * As good as the networks are at branding "We know drama" "Characters welcome" the sites are getting good -- you go to CollegeHumor for penile humor
  * Break.com spending $5k/$10k per episode for some of the better content, up from $300 -- compared with Networks which are cutting spedning every year
* It's the people that give clips legitimacy -- if you (trusted friend) send me the clip, then I'll trust it (doesn't matter the originating source of content)
* "If the chocolate rain guy moved you to tears, would you have shared it?" -- Novak
  * Does comedy move faster on the Web than beauty or insight?
  * It's about identity creation, people want show their friends their funny
  * You don't want to share sad clips, for the most part 
  * There's probably fewer people trying to be inspirational each night in front of their cameras (it's an inventory thing)
* Web is a stepping stone to TV, will that change where Web is the end result?
  * Sounds like not, as long as the money is in TV/Film.
  * Only a few celebrities have done much on the Internet, are they scared of it?
    * Novak - Yes, it's new. The cameraman can't say "I also shot for Scorsese"
    * It's democratic -- Cuba Gooding Jr. did videos on Break but a pro-am beat him every week with views and shares
* Twitter might save live/appointment television viewing?
  * Novak -- No. Office is being mostly watched timeshifted
  * Boxee guy -- I don't know what time Office is on
  * Panel doesn't think Twitter can bring back appointment viewing
  * Novak -- The consumers will make what they want happen... Dad worried about books being electronic, months later 'Do you know anyone who has a kindle?'
* Attention spans -- Is the era of a 44 minute show over?
  * Boxee -- When on train "snack on clips", when at home maybe want more
  * Only people should be worried are people making content that folks don't like b/c users vote with their clicks
  * People used to bitch about the TV shows they passively consumed are in trouble with the Internet, you don't click on something you don't want -- Novak
* What are you afraid of? What are you looking forward to?
  * Hits will continue to be hits, but there's not going to be as much mediocraty -- Break.com
  * If you can write/produce/act/direct you'll succeed -- can make content more effecitvely, more cheaply, more quickly
