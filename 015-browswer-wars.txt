# Browser Wars III: The Platform Wins
http://sxsw.mobi/interactive/conference/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP0900700

* 3rd year of panel
* 20th anniversary of the Web
* Apple not speaking on panel, but there is a WebKit speaker
* Brendan Eich invented javascript
* What's in it for Google in the browser game?
  * Google - how can we make Firefox more successfull, then looking at how to radically improve browsers through coopetition
  * Didn't want to create another rendering engine -- Gecko and WebKit choices
    * WebKit fast, but JS engine wasn't as fast
    * Simpler code base
    * Small memory footprint
    * Gecko is a full platform for building apps
    * Google cooperates with Apple
* Declining market share of IE6 -- there's no single majority browsing engine (IE versions considered different)
* Standards
  * IE -- Silverlight is a lot like things inside HTML5
  * What's your skin in the game and what's going on with Silverlight?
    * It's easier to build a single implementation platform
    * But it's difficult to spread that around like open standards
  * There are scenarious where folks will use a closed-world system like Silverlight or Flash
  * But to get out into the world you have to use standards
  * It's harder to push forward the standards b/c it's not one company, but in the end it tends to win
* Web is likely, if we continue to cooperate with the standards body, indistinguishable from Flash and Silverlight
  * It's not a little harder, it's a lot harder
  * Politics on top of cross-implementation specs
* Standards are like sausages, you don't want to know how they're made
* Talk about license of HTML5 license -- to make it an open source license
  * How does it sit with MS to have standards developed like open source apps?
    * Difference between licenses -- do whatever you want vs. viral
    * Do you allow forking of HTML5?
    * Probably true that a license wouldn't keep people from gravitating away from HTML5 if the spec was bad
* If there is a type of war, it's about Javascript
  * JS performance and how JS standards are built are an area of contention
  * People are building great big piles of javascript -- ECMA trying to evolve rapidly
  * Get everyone cooperating on material improvements
  * ECMA is a fairly functional group -- trouble is writing the spec in an old untestable prose-filled form
  * If everyone used the same engine -- you'd end up binding to the semantics of the code and not the semantics of the spec
* Do you think V8 performance tests are fair?
  * Benchmarks derived from a set of applications they wanted to make fast
  * Javascript makes the browser a platform for applications -- Opera's speed wasn't noticed until dev community started using it as such
  * Making a more efficient JS engine for mobile is key to battery life
* Security & Privacy
  * IE8 came out with their own clickjacking prevention
  * XHR was IE's own thing
  * Primary attribute of security is that you need to respond very quickly else you hang them out to dry
  * Security is in two parts: Web security and protecting your OS from the Web

We're doing *so darn much* with the Web platform these days, from cross-domain access mechanisms to new drawing and graphics tools. But in the end, we still have to deal with different web browsers. This discussion brings the leads from Mozilla (Firefox), Microsoft (IE), Google (Chrome) and Opera (Opera) together for yet another incendiary discussion about the future of the web.
