# User Generated Content: State of the Union
http://sxsw.mobi/interactive/conference/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP0901401

* Between 2008 and 2009 all the new sites on top 10 list are UGC -- eBay, Wikimedia, Facebook, Yahoo Sites
* Two problems with audience -- How to get folks to participate? How do you deal w/participation?
  * Then how do you monetize it
* News & Reference today, but what's next
* IncSpring -- Designers upload fake brands/products.
  * Reverse market -- comapnies come to look for logos/brands that they buy
* Mosso guy -- UGC creates huge volumes of content that you want to store/manage as cheaply as you can
* 2 years == 10 years on the Internet
* "How are we all going to get paid?"
  * Advertising -- YouTube, Facebook
  * Rackspace works with the smaller folks - hot/not
    * Create an auction model where the best UGC bubbles up to the top -- Digg, eBay, etc.
  * Reality TV - "everyday people"/funniest videos reducing costs of TV production
  * Sites like Gracenote/IMDB can't exist without UGC
  * Which sites will succeed -- those that take in and monetize or those that can't exist w/out UGC
  * LinkedIn - taking in $4 million in ad revenue
  * When your using a free service, users expect that the company will make money off it somehow
  * Looking at "let's get rich together" model -- cmpany and users get paid
  * Individual contribution isn't as valuable as the collective
* Users suck
  * "Fucking great campaign #skittles" / Skittles homepage
  * One day later the new home page goes down
  * You get a "mob mentality" -- all threadless shirts are alike, Digg users like/hate certain topics
  * Maybe join the unwieldly mob that appeals to you
  * How do I keep the riffraff from destroying my site?
    * With any UGC, they'll figure out the system
    * Takes people to monitor
    * IncSpring has a strong approval policy (open posting lasted about a week)
    * Mob has a general self interest in keeping the site a fun and interesting place
    * NYTimes -- Opera forum ran itself, Middle East forum was "a mess" yet with a moderator there were still big ideas being discussed
    * Craiglist -- highly positive brand image, yet 50% of hits are for prostitution so personal branding works
    * "Bitching" is the killer application for the Internet
    * Digg -- used to resize window to avoid seeing content, but added rating system and automatic threshold so crowd-voted "good" content appears
    * Get your audience rating your UGC content as soon as possible, downplay urgency
* What structure do you put in place w/UGC so that it's not "mob rule"?
  * Invest early on in user filtering
  * Set the tone early in the game
  * Put as much data structure as you can in place to 
  * /. karma, Digg ratings, Open Directory moderators can bless lower moderators who can bless even lower moderators
  * THe more transparent you are the harder it is to game the system
  * Twitter -- only engage with people you know, makes it difficult to spam
    * Compare MySpace (geocities) to Facebook where everything has to be through friends
  * Noone out there is flaw free
  * Social software is software that can be spamed -- first virus developer
  * As long as you have an engaged community, they'll tell you what needs to be taken down
* Whats strategy for attracting the really good UGC to your site
  * FB / MySpace has to worry about that
  * Gracenote / IMDB is about the data blow off from the users, so less of an issue
  * Saleable UGC content vs. I just want a bunch of eyeballs
 * Is the term UGC too broad these days?
   * Worst is better :-) UGC means something to the audience at SXSW but "Communicty Curated Content" doesn't click
   * Mosso guy hates the term cloud computing, but its what people know
   * UGC takes the humanity out of the actual content
* Suggestions to generate critical mass
  * Every journalist I know thinks Digg is awesome, because they can self-promote 
  * Give the people a platform that allows them to self-promote
  * It takes a long time... Craigslist took 10-15 years now they make $100 million/year, content as a loss-leader into jobs listings
  * Digg -- made $8/million in the first 3/4s of last year
  * Customer site can be a "tip of the spear" for a B2B business
  * Google wants you to search on hawaii vacations, but seraching on your name is a loss-leader
  * Content gets better the focused the community is -- microcommunities and Google serves as aggregator via search
  * Firehoses like twitter will probably be broke up, imagine a site for each #hash tag
* PepsiCo - what/how have social technologies where audience is my employees
  * Let your users not get fired
  * Have the CEO do stuff

## My takeaways
* Ad-supported monetization is tough unless you've got targeted audience and/or a good sales staff
* Invest early in user filtering/promotion to weed the cream from the crap
* Pair that with efforts to build an engaged, self-policing community, they have a vested interest in keeping the site interesting and fun
* UGC may be a good loss leader to drive audience to your more profitable content
* Despite the focus on the user, individuals matter less than the collective
* Transparency and tone are key
* Make your platform easily enable user self promotion
* Niche audiences are easier to monetize, easier to keep "in control", and easier to consume, yet revenues will be smaller -- may auger for more content-networks

## Panel information
Friday, March 13th

2:00 pm - 3:00 pm

It's been a few years since YouTube and Flickr have dropped on the scene. Now almost everyone you know is creating content and posting it online. With the idea of User Generated Content now proven and the infrastructure in place where are we today? The same old questions keep popping up. "Where do you make money?" "How do you stand out?" and "Where do you find the time?" The panel will take a look at these questions and others as we explore the ever changing landscape of User Generated Content. This panel is sponsored by Ideagin.com
