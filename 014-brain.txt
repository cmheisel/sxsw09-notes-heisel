# Presenting Straight to the Brain

* Attention -- always being inundated for our attention
* Stimuli everywhere, multitasking apps on our machine at work even
* Mobile devices making it even worse
* Presentations in the past just don't work in that kind of environment
* Engage your audience, understand the psychology of your audience, and indentify different learning styles
* No research that says that bullet points is better than any other way
* What were doing with presentation software today we're doing b/c we're doing it
* Cambridge Handbook of Multimedia Learning Edited by Richard E. Mayer 
* Sender -> receiver assumption: If the audience didn't get it, it's there fault we gave it too them after all
* 3 things can really happen
  * No learning
  * Fragmented learning
  * Meaningful learning -- what you intended to teach, you did
* Have to change the shape of our own assumptions about working
* 3 parts of memory
  * Sensory
  * Long term memory
  * Working memory -- 3 to 4 chunks of info in our attention at any one time
* Info pipelines have turned into firehoses, but working memory hasn't changed
* Have to thread the "eye of the needle" from sensory to long-term
* Respect the limits of the mind
* Sync the two channels (sensory and long term)
  * Visual and verbal channel in synx
* Guide attention -- "Here's what you should be paying attention to"
* People are reading bullets at one speed, but presenter is speaking them at a different speed -- like a film dialog out of sync
* Look at power point as a film strip -- beg/mid/end with a story line and an audio track that's sync'd with the visuals
* Cognitive seduction
  * Brain's are not your friend -- they think we're living in a cave
  * Studying "this book is sooo not life threatening, but starvation is, how about a pizza?"
  * Brain and mind are in an epic battle
  * Can't tune brain's spam filter
  * Chemistry -- that which you feel, anything that causes a physical reaction
  * Cares about things that aren't expected
  * Things that stand out
  * Or to pay attention to people who look like they're afraid
  * Someone having a joyful experience
  * Tuned to pay attention to faces
  * Mystery -- things that aren't fully formed -- what's the story
* Doesn't care about
  * Doesn't care about code
  * Marry a compelling picture with code -- cheap trick
  * Show an awful diagram that says "oh god that's bad" and then the code that solves it
  * Talk to the brain, not the mind
* Study on juror information retention -- after 3 days (ave trial length) they might retain 10%, visual 20%, with both in sync 65%
  * Used early power point/slides to highlight information
  * Started working with timelines
  * PowerPoint doesn't have to be linear
  * The "Ken Burns Effect" -- sync'd music with panning/zooming photos
  * Animated car crash scene with stock photograph
  * $100 offer if you don't learn what you're supposed to learn -- adds drama and makes everyone pay attention
* Use visual as a visual prompt to yourself, to remind you what you want to say
* Can't hear text and read text at the same time
* Ignite talks -- 20 slides in 5 minutes or Larry Lessig 100 slides quickly
* When is appropriate to use bullet points?
  * Can we just keep doing what we're doing --- in film when is appropriate to put bullet points in film?
  * Tell a story
  * Though sometimes you want to show a collection of stuff, if you're trying not to convey each individual point
  * If the bullet point has to wrap... it's too long
* Can I help make you more interesting at your next dinner party?
* If it's a handout, it's not a slide, don't ever use templates, use pop culture
* Does it have an emotional resonance?
* Determine 3 most important points, tell a story with it
* How do we change audience expecations of PowerPoint culture?
  * Tell them it's not based on research
  * Do both, mix and mash styles
* How to deal with different education levels && computer-based training?
  * Sometime redundancy of messages actually works better than tailoring to individual learning styles
* Interruptions? Presenations have to be portable b/c they're shared??
  * Use power points notes page view to sync visual and verbal
  * Instead of interruptions, make it a dialogue
  *

Is there a way out of the oppressive PowerPoint culture that surrounds us? Yes: skip the fonts and graphics talk, and explore how the human mind learns. When you accept what the research says about the brain, you'll have no choice but to present a clear and compelling multimedia story.
