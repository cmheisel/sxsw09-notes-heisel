* What we want to talk about has very little to do w/economic indicators
* Not here to tell you what you should make, or what your ultimate goals should be
* Assumptions
  * All of you make things
  * Care about things, verging on obsessions
  * That you want to get better at
  * Matters to have the credibility and respect of the people you admine
  * Would not mind making a little bit of money, or finding an opportunity beyond self improvement aspects
* "We don't make movies to make movies, we make money to make more movies" -- Walt Disney
* You shouldn't care about Gruber, if he's not in your target audience
  * And we both should be cool about each other not caring about you
  * It's confidence to know what you want to say, and who you want to say it to
* Topic X Voice (or Obession X Voice)
  * Best non fiction comes from someone who can't stop thinking about a certain topic, a very specific aspect of the topic
  * If you have a topic without voice -- you have reblogging without curation
  * If you have voice w/out obsession -- commenting on the thai food they just had
* Whatever your topic is try and be better at than 80% of the world
  * Probably won't be, but that's OK, it's what to strive for
  * Have a goal that you know in your mind you'll never reach -- but it makes you better
  * If everything is what you want to do, then nothing is what you're doing
* Mann -- always over the map
  * Who do I want to delight?
  * Is this something that (your hero) saw, would think is a piece of crap
  * Think about your "ideal reader" or your "first reader"
* If you want to reach a broad audience, that's fine -- reach the shit out of a broad audience
  * But keep thinking about your ideal reader, if you hope (your hero) will find this article
* WWDC announcement to 4,000 people who only want to write Obj-C, and they say here's the greatest thing about apps on iPhone -- write them in Web (let down)
  * Phil Schiller runs into Gruber and says "I gotta disagree about the shit sandwhich thing" :-) -- but (his hero) read his post
* "There's a lot people who go out and want to emulate the success of other people, and you try and copy Ted Koppel. But you know what they already have a Ted Koppel" -- Ira Glass
* Instincts say if you want to write something you should write about something that someone is already enjoying
  * Sci-fi crapflood after Star Wars from 1978-84 (aside from BSG)
* Koppel was Koppel b/c of the Iranian hostage crisis
  * Peter Jennings has 30 minutes to cover everything
  * Koppel is obsessed about it, he says "what time is available" and they give him the 30 minutes in the late night 
  * 30 minutes about the exact same topic _every_ night
  * If you want to be Koppel, you'll need a red wig and a time machine
* Are you copying the right thing when you emulate something else?
  * 37Signals -- thing that's worth copying was the attitude they had: communication vs. ganntt charts
  * Google -- a white page with 2 buttons will not make you the most profitable comapny in the world
  * Zappos -- Getting an account on Twitter doesn't make you Zappos -- millions on customer care make you Zappos
  * Social media isn't about what you have to say, it's having a tolerance for what people say about you
    * Social media/SEO is a giant cabinet of sharp knives -- you can use them for good or evil
* Freedom of the press belongs to those who can afford one
  * Now everyone has a press -- BoingBoing was a 'zine
  * $7/month hosting account and you can saturate your audience
* Blog is not that great of a term
  * From Gawker to Blogspot to corporate press releases w/a permalink
  * It's not that we want for tools
  * It's super easy to post
* How do you know you should start a blog -- people keep telling you to shut up (or marry the topic)
* It's not easy to make money blogging
  * A lot of people are BSing
  * The giant opportunities are not short term gaines -- CPMs/Page views -- it's the long term gains
  * People that had tolerance for the ambiguity of how it'd play out have succeeded -- ancillary revenue streams make it in the long term
  * Gruber: You'll get paid in attention -- but it has value and you'll be surprised at what happens when it builds up
  * Don't have a blog about Star Wars, have a blog about Jawas -- or that one Jawa in that one scene
  * In the world of Apple, you go to daringfireball -- what happened, what it means and what he thinks abou it
    * How many people can do all 3 things?
* Gruber: Got e-mail asking how he could do what Gruber did
  1. Give away more stuff than you possibly think you should and make it easy to find
  2. Have an eye open for 2ndary revenue streams
  3. Don't go after profits that harm the reasons people like you
* Mann: In 2007, talk at Google... talked about e-mail to people who really needed to hear about it (inbox zero)
  * Check out Merlin Mann video -- 400,000 views
  * Now people come ask him to talk to their companies -- vs. if he had said you have to pay a nickel to watch that video
* Lizard brain idea of "how do I make a little money off of this"
  * My ideas are so valuable that I'm not worry I'll run out of them -- I am not my RSS feed
* Don't become so obsessed with the thing your determined to make money on
  * 

## My takeaways
* As a blogger focus on your passion and your voice
* Decide what your target audience is, be a douche about not caring about the rest of the audience
* Be unique
* Know how to wield SEO, social media, etc. for good -- they're a drawer of sharp knives
* Within your passion -- be the authority on what happened, what it means and what you think about it

Saturday, March 14th

3:30 pm - 4:30 pm

John Gruber (DaringFireball.net) and Merlin Mann (43Folders.com) discuss the current state of blogging as a medium for creative expression, weighing the opportunities and challenges of building a thoughtful online presence in a world where everybody owns a printing press. They'll consider the ascendance of Digg-friendly "problogs" and debate the subtler pleasures of careful writing that reaches smaller, but potentially less "profitable" audiences.
